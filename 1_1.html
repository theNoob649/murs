    <p>The 1.1 update was mostly a bug-fix patch but also introduced some key features to improve gameplay.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Spawn Eggs:</strong> Added to creative mode, allowing players to spawn mobs instantly.</li>
      <li><strong>Added Structures:</strong> Villages got improvements with more varied buildings.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance Enhancements:</strong> Optimized game engine for smoother gameplay.</li>
      <li><strong>New Command:</strong> The <code>/gamerule</code> command introduced for customizing gameplay rules.</li>
      <li><strong>Texture Improvements:</strong> Several block textures and sounds updated for better immersion.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While not a huge content update, 1.1 polished Minecraft and set the stage for bigger features ahead.</p>
