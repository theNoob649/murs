    <h2>Minecraft Pre-Classic</h2>
    <h3>Release Date: May 10, 2009</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The very first phase of Minecraft’s development, Pre-Classic was a simple creative sandbox with limited blocks and basic terrain generation. There were no survival elements, no mobs, and no crafting — just raw building fun in a blocky world.</p>
    <p>This early stage laid the foundation for what would become the iconic Minecraft experience, experimenting with infinite worlds and basic block placement mechanics.</p>
    <p>Though primitive by today’s standards, Pre-Classic sparked the creative freedom that would define Minecraft’s future.</p>
