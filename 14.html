    <h3>Release Date: April 23, 2019</h3>

    <p>The Village & Pillage update completely revamped villages, adding new designs for different biomes and more dynamic villager behavior.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pillagers:</strong> Hostile mobs that attack villages with crossbows.</li>
      <li><strong>Ravagers:</strong> Large, tough mobs that serve as powerful attackers during raids.</li>
      <li><strong>Wandering Traders:</strong> Traders that roam and offer rare items.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other highlights included new blocks like the Bell, Loom, and Campfire, as well as the introduction of raids—a new village defense challenge.</p>
