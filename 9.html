    <h2>Minecraft 1.9: The Combat Update</h2>
    <h3>Release Date: February 29, 2016</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The Combat Update overhauled Minecraft’s battle mechanics. Cooldowns were added to weapons, making spamming attacks ineffective. Shields replaced sword blocking, dual-wielding became possible, and new arrows introduced potion effects to ranged combat.</p>
    <p>But the most iconic change? The End itself.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Ender Dragon fight was redesigned with iron bars protecting healing crystals and more varied attack phases.</li>
      <li>Players can now respawn the Ender Dragon by crafting and placing End Crystals on the exit portal.</li>
      <li>End Cities and End Ships spawned after the dragon’s defeat, containing Elytra and valuable loot.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>1.9 didn’t just change combat—it gave players a reason to return to The End.</p>
