    <h2>Minecraft 1.21: Tricky Trials</h2>
    <h3>Release Date: June 13, 2024</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>The Tricky Trials update introduced Trial Chambers—randomized dungeon structures packed with traps, loot, and the new Breeze mob, known for its wind-powered attacks. Ominous Trials brought riskier challenges with greater rewards, while Vault loot expanded late-game gearing options.</p>
    <p>But Mojang didn’t stop at launch content:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Happy Ghast</strong> (added in 1.21.8): A new variant of the Ghast. The player must find a "Dried Ghast" in the Nether and place it in a water source block in the Overworld to spawn a Happy Ghast.</li>
      <li><strong>Copper Armor & Tools</strong> (added in 1.21.9): A stylish new gear tier, stronger than stone but weaker than iron.</li>
      <li><strong>Bugfix patches</strong> (1.21.1 – 1.21.7): Improved dungeon balance, Breeze AI, and vault loot drops.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This update turned Minecraft into a true dungeon crawler with loot and surprises constantly evolving in post-release patches.</p>
