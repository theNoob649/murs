    <h3>Release Date: May 17, 2009</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>Minecraft Classic was the very first public version of Minecraft available to the world. It was purely creative mode, with no survival mechanics or mobs. Players could place and remove blocks freely, exploring the basic building system that would become Minecraft’s core.</p>
    <p>The game was simple, blocky, and limited, but it laid the foundation for everything that came after.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Creative mode only: infinite blocks and free building</li>
      <li>No mobs or survival mechanics</li>
      <li>Basic block types and simple world generation</li>
      <li>Limited world size and no save system at first</li>
    </ul>
